It is a 2 player game, in which each player gets a chance to roll the dice until the dice rolls 1. 
Before the dice rolls a one, the player can either hold the score and add it to his\her total score or keep rolling the dice.
Once the dice rolls a one, the current score of the player will become zero and the chance will be given to next player.
The first player to score a total of 100 points, wins the game.
